Welcome to your new TanStack Start app!

# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
bun install
bun --bun run dev
```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
bun --bun run build
```

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Uninstall the packages: `bun install @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss -D`

## Setting up Better Auth

1. Generate and set the `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable in your `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   bunx --bun @better-auth/cli secret
   ```

2. Visit the [Better Auth documentation](https://www.better-auth.com) to unlock the full potential of authentication in your app.

3. Configure OAuth providers in `.env.local`:

   ```dotenv
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
   DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=
   ```

4. Add OAuth redirect URLs in provider consoles:
   - Google:
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
     - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Discord:
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord`
     - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/discord`

### Adding a Database (Optional)

Better Auth can work in stateless mode, but to persist user data, add a database:

```typescript
// src/lib/auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth'
import { Pool } from 'pg'

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  }),
  // ... rest of config
})
```

Then run migrations:

```bash
bunx --bun @better-auth/cli migrate
```

## Drizzle + Cloudflare D1

This project includes Drizzle schema/config for the app tables in `src/db/schema.ts`.

Generate SQL migrations from schema changes:

```bash
bun --bun run db:generate
```

Push the current schema directly to remote D1 using Drizzle's `d1-http` driver:

```bash
bun --bun run db:push
```

Required environment variables for `db:push`:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID` (or `DB_ID`)
- `CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN` (or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`)

## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/solid-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from '@tanstack/solid-router'
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/solid/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Server Functions

TanStack Start provides server functions that allow you to write server-side code that seamlessly integrates with your client components.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/solid-start'

const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString()
})
```

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/solid-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      <For each={data().results}>{(person) => <li>{person.name}</li>}</For>
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

# Demo files

Files prefixed with `demo` can be safely deleted. They are there to provide a starting point for you to play around with the features you've installed.

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting. Eslint is configured using [tanstack/eslint-config](https://tanstack.com/config/latest/docs/eslint). The following scripts are available:

```bash
bun --bun run lint
bun --bun run format
bun --bun run check
```
